A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
   Using this calculator, you can input the values for the principal amount, time period, and annual interest rate, and it will compute the simple interest based on these inputs. Simple interest is commonly used in scenarios such as loans or investments where interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount without considering any additional contributions or compounding interest.
