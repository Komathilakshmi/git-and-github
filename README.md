A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
   This calculator is designed to compute the simple interest on a principal amount over a specified time period at a given annual interest rate. Simple interest is a basic form of interest calculation where the interest is directly proportional to the principal amount, the time period, and the annual interest rate.

Here's how the formula works:

Simple Interest = Principal (P) × Time (T) × Rate (R)

Where:

P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
T is the time period in years
R is the annual rate of interest (expressed as a decimal)
The formula you provided, simple interest = p * t * r, is a simplified version of the formula above, where p represents the principal amount, t represents the time period in years, and r represents the annual rate of interest.

Using this calculator, you can input the values for the principal amount, time period, and annual interest rate, and it will compute the simple interest based on these inputs. Simple interest is commonly used in scenarios such as loans or investments where interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount without considering any additional contributions or compounding interest.
